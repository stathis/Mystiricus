Browser based question game written in PHP.

Mystiricus was developed in 2009 by mostly by me with the help of classmates as well as teachers from my school. The project was presented at the 1st Panhellenic Informatics Conference in NOESIS center in Thessaloniki that year.

This repository is mainly for historical reasons. Bugs might exist in the software, or may not be suitable for real world use.

To install and see Mystiricus in action, upload the files to your server, import the .sql file, create the include/config.php file, and you're good to go.
